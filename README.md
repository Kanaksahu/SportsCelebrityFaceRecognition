# Image-Classification-Machine-Learning

One of the core problems in computer vision, which is image classification. It is defined as the task of classifying an image from a fixed set of categories. Many other computer vision challenges such as object detection and segmentation can be reduced to image classification. This is an end to end machine learning project or data science project for sports celebrity image classification. In this project, I've learnt how projects are executed in big companies ina typical corporate environment. I tried to classify an image of my favourite 5 sports people. While working on this project I learnt,

1) How to build end to end machine learning or data science project
2) Use Opencv library for face and eyes detection
3) data cleaning using opencv face detection and feature engineering using wavelet transforms
4) Model building using SVM, logistic regression, random  forest
5) Model fine tunning using gridsearchcv
6) Export model to a file and write python flask server around it that can server http requests generated by UI
7) Build ui using HTML,CSS,javascript and JQuery
